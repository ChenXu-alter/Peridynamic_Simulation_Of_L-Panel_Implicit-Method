# Peridynamic_Simulation_Of_L-Panel_Implicit-Method


This the Peridynamic simulation of L-shaped panel test, using implicit arc-length method.


## Guide:
1. Please download the Eigen library at first, refer to: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
2. Follow the instruction mentioned at the beginning of C++ main program to finish the environment configuration.
3. I have provided the running results of the program. The VTK files can be post-processed via Paraview.
